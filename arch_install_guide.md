This file was based from the ArchWiki. It is modified to include instructions for grub, and if you follow along exactly you will end up with a working arch install. I set this up inside a virtual machine in proxmox, but it should work the same in a real pc.

# Arch Linux Installation Guide
This document is a guide for installing [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux) using the live system booted from an installation medium made from an official installation image. The installation medium provides accessibility features which are described on the page [Install Arch Linux with accessibility options](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Install_Arch_Linux_with_accessibility_options). For alternative means of installation, see [Category:Installation process](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Category:Installation_process).

Before installing, it would be advised to view the [FAQ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/FAQ). For conventions used in this document, see [Help:Reading](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Reading). In particular, code examples may contain placeholders (formatted in italics) that must be replaced manually.

This guide is kept concise and you are advised to follow the instructions in the presented order per section. For more detailed instructions, see the respective [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ArchWiki) articles or the various programs' [man pages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Man_page), both linked from this guide. For interactive help, the [IRC channel](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/IRC_channel) and the [forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/) are also available.

Arch Linux should run on any x86_64-compatible machine with a minimum of 512 MiB RAM, though more memory is needed to boot the live system for installation.[1] A basic installation should take less than 2 GiB of disk space. As the installation process needs to retrieve packages from a remote repository, this guide assumes a working internet connection is available.
